 # pyDactyl

This is a recreation of [Adereth's Dactyl keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) using the [pyKeeb python library](https://github.com/raycewest/pykeeb). pyKeeb uses [openpyscad](https://github.com/taxpon/openpyscad) to generate and openscad model from instructions written in python. 

This project was conceived after I printed my own dactyl. Although the dactyl is a wonderfully ergonomic keyboard, I felt that I wanted to make my own tweaks tailored to my hand size and shape. Using the pyKeeb library, and some trigonometry, I was able to make a pretty darn close replica of the dactyl. It is not identical, but close enough for me. It was from this starting point I was able to start customizing to my heart's desire.

I am publishing this code for anyone that has felt like they wanted to tweak the dactyl but have been too intimidated by the dacytl's Clojure code to do so.

Enjoy!
